# milight-opencomputers
An OpenComputers lua module for controlling Mi-Light brand bulbs (and LimitlessLED, etc)

#Info
This code was used to teach children age 10-14 lua basics at the Sheffield Steelcon security conference kids track in 2016.
(https://www.steelcon.info/)
It includes modules for sending commands to the Mi-Light bulb and for using the robots from the Minecraft OpenComputers mod to detect color from adjacent blocks and relay tot the bulb.

# Notes
*You must first sync your bulbs with the bridge in udp mode and then switch over to TCP mode, in order to be able to send command via minecraft
