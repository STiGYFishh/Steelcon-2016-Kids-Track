# milight-opencomputers
An OpenComputers lua module for controlling Mi-Light brand bulbs (and LimitlessLED, etc)

#Info
This code was used to teach children age 10-14 lua basics at the Sheffield Steelcon security conference kids track in 2016.(https://www.steelcon.info/)
It includes modules for sending commands to the milight bulb and for using the robots from the minecraft opencomputers mods to detect color based on adjacent blocks.

# Notes
*You must first sync your bulbs with the bridge in udp mode and then switch over to TCP mode, in order to be able to send command via minecraft
